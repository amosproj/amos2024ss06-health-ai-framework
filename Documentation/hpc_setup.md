# ðŸ’» Setting Up Your Project in FAU's HPC Environment

This guide will help you set up your project on FAU's High-Performance Computing system.


## ðŸ”‘ Creating SSH Key and Adding it to Your HPC Account

To access FAU's High-Performance Computing (HPC) system, you'll need to create an SSH key pair and add the public key to your HPC account. Follow the steps outlined in the [SSH Command Line documentation](https://doc.nhr.fau.de/access/ssh-command-line/) provided by FAU.

Once you've completed these steps, you should be able to log in to the HPC system securely using SSH without entering your password each time.


## ðŸ’» Connecting to Tiny GPU

```bash
ssh tinyx.nhr.fau.de
```

Once the connection is successfully made, terminal prompt will change to something like this:

```bash
YOUR_HPC_USER_NAME@tinyx:~$
```


## ðŸ”§ Loading Modules in the Shell

To **make Python 3.10 available** in your shell for project, you can use the following command:

```bash
module add python/3.10-anaconda
```


## ðŸ§° Installing PDM for Your Project

To **install PDM**, which is a dependency for project, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -
```

To **make PDM executable** from your terminal, you can use the following command:

```bash
export PATH=/home/hpc/amos/$(whoami)/.local/bin:$PATH
```


## ðŸ“¦ Making Modules and PDM Available System-wide

To ensure that the **required modules and PDM are available system-wide** without needing to manually add them each time, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your **home directory** (`~`) using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```

2. **Create** a `.bash_login` file if it doesn't already exist:
   
   ```bash
   touch .bash_login
   ```

3. **Open** the `.bash_login` file in a text editor of your choice:
   
   ```bash
   nano .bash_login
   ```

4. **Add** the following lines to the `.bash_login` file:
   
   ```bash
   module add python/3.10-anaconda
   export PATH=/home/hpc/amos/$(whoami)/.local/bin:$PATH
   ```

5. **Save and close** the file (`Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`, followed by `Ctrl + X` in nano).

6. To **apply the changes**, either restart your terminal or run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_login
   ```

Now, the required modules and PDM will be automatically loaded whenever you open a new terminal session, making them readily available for your project.
