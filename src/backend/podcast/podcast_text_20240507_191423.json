episode to celebrate this milestone we're going to do something a little different for this episode but it's going to mirror the structure of a recent interview i did which i thought was kind of interesting for today's episode we're going to cover a variety of topics which you have all weighed in on and i'm going to rank them into the following categories proven promising fuzzy noise and nonsense couple of months ago some of you may recall i put out a video on social media where i asked people to weigh in on the types of topics that they wanted to hear covered and we got a lot of responses literally thousands of responses we've sorted those into different categories and we're about to cover half of them here turns out the response was far in excess of what we predicted they will have to finish this another time but nevertheless in this conversation we're going to cover juror protective drugs including rapper my son and eighty and it's precursors metformin resveratrol going to talk about vo to max muscle mass blood flow restriction stem cells and then we talk about nutrition specifically questions you had around long term fasting sugar sugar substitutes and the role of red meat in cancer so all of these topics have generally been covered in greater detail across the previous three hundred episodes and or across our newsletter over the past ten years we will certainly point you back to areas where we go into great detail into these topics but the goal here today is that if you're coming to these topics without any background or you just want the t l d r this is the place for you so as such if you want to learn more of course check out the show notes both here and elsewhere and i would just say before we jump into this i want to thank everybody for being a part of the drive whether this is your first episode or your three hundred it is an absolute honor to be learning in front of you and that's exactly how i feel about this so without further delay please enjoy this episode celebrating three hundred episodes of the drive and counter we're working to a special podcast tighter very good thank you so today for this episode we are actually celebrating three hundred episodes so i think the first question is did you ever think we would get to episode three hundred when we started this seven years ago recording the first few was at seven years ago or six years ago well it's launched in june twenty eight team but we were recording previous because the original episodes were you doing book research right yeah that's right so started having some of these discussions and voice or the i never really thought about it to me it was like binary right it we sort of it as a twelve part series and it was like either this is gonna be uninteresting unhelpful useless and which it dies or it's gonna be potentially interesting and valuable and will keep doing it but once we had that binary spot where after three months we said yeah let's keep doing it i never and i never really thought of milestones in that way so what we like to do for every hundred episodes as can adjust to a special episode seven a little different release it to everybody shot as an am a but just a little bit of a different style and so when we're thinking of how we wanted to do this one we thought of a recent interview you dead which was structured and away we kind of liked which was you giving your opinion on various drugs supplements behaviors interventions and putting them in the following categories proven promising fuzzy noise nonsense and we thought it was kind of a cool way to go through and talk about some of these different things and a little detail and categorize and so people can understand how you think about him how you apply to your life applying to your patience and so a lot of what we're going to cover here in a lot of these topics are things that we've covered in various podcast newsletters and will link to those so the goal here isn't to be super and apps go through all these studies all this background research will link to those in the show notes for anyone who's interested but this is gonna be more conversation where it's version comes to you and said peter i'm thinking about rapper my sin should i take it how do you think about it that kind of style self we have a lot to cover i think it will be really interesting so that said before we start anything you want to add all the content for today's podcast is coming in from an instagram post that i put up several months ago basically saying that we were going to do just that and asking people to leave their comments and then some very unfortunate soul on our team had to go through two or three thousand comments and he's out the threads because obviously there were like repetitive ones i think what we should also explain to voters what emerged was a really good list of which we will do half right now because that's how much good stuff emerged that's how many good questions emerge so not gonna wait till episode four hundred to come back and finish the other half of that list but yeah everything that we're talking about the day has come out of listener questions that came out of that instagram post and then i guess i'll just say one more thing about we use the terms proven promising fuzzy as heuristics what what do i really mean by those think so i want to be really clear and people of her missy this before in biology there is no such thing as proof this is not physics or mathematics or and i would say even physics and you might argue outside of theoretical physics but in biology it's just all probability and when we say proven what we're really saying is what we're talking about has such well established data that the probability that it is untrue is so small that it would be foolish to not act on it now conversely promising says the claim looks really good there are a lot of data supporting it but there's a piece that's missing there's something that's missing from a data perspective either there isn't just quite enough human data are there just isn't quite enough rct data are there just isn't quite there are some slight thing that's missing that good keep you from saying this is effectively proven fuzzy is really going to be shorthand for there are some data around this claim but they might be not the best data they might be inconsistent they might be contradictory and i don't just mean like one study is contradicting another study but it's like know there's real contradictions here and therefore we clearly need to do more before we could elevate this noise is an interesting category and it largely says that the data out there today are not have sufficient quality to make a judgment but there might be something kind of compelling that could move this in the other direction for example there might be very compelling mechanistic data there might be a very compelling biochemical story around and idea that the data have just been too small to incomplete to even elevated up to fuzzy and by the way noise can quickly turn into nonsense when you shine enough light on it and nonsense basically says no actually this has been studied and it's bonk we really have a high degree of confidence in saying that there is nothing there that should be paid attention to and that doesn't actually mean it's harmful but it means that this is not doing what people say it is doing all of it takes a long time to explain so i don't want have to explain it every time but i think explaining it up front hopefully gives people a sense of where we are and then of course with each example will provide enough detail to rationalize that position hopefully he another thing to add to their is let's say we did this in another hundred episodes what we're going to talk about with new evidence can easily move up or down the chain so it's not even like this is howard as in this or will be and that's the beauty of science and what we've seen a lot of as as new evidence comes out you're happy to change your opinion on what you think about things yup then if we did this hundred episodes ago i can even look at this list and tell you think they would have said different hundred episodes ago and i would be foolish to suggest that one hundred episodes from now if we come back and revisit this list i will have the exact same things to say about it i think that's very unlikely well let's get into it and we can have categorize the different things will talk about so there's deems to these sections and the first theme is joe protective drugs molecules these are rapamycin metformin an id raspberry troll will start with rapper my son but before we do do you want to quickly remind people your definition of a job protective dragan kind of how you think about that gas and giro protection really talks more broadly about mechanisms that target hallmarks of aging so a juror protective drug would be a drug or a molecule that you're taking not because it necessarily provides benefit in one arena against one chronic disease or one symptom but rather because you believe it is fundamentally altering the biology of aging and as such taking this drug moves things in your favor and that should mean that you would live longer taking this drug and so that's a very high bar there are lots of drugs that are really effective at doing things that wouldn't quite rise to the level of being sort of giro protective so that said let's start with wrap my son obviously a molecule we get asked about an insane amount seems like it's popularity is gone up what do you put wrapping my son and i'm gonna put rapamycin in the promising category and hopefully been a minute or two or three her i'd like to convince people of why i think it's promising but clearly not proven we've covered rapamycin so much another podcast and this podcast is in no way meant to displace or be a substitute for those things so if you really want to go deep on this you gotta go back and see the content in the show notes we will link to all the places where i've done this but at a high level rapper my son is a substance that was discovered from a bacteria discovered on easter island in the god probably the mid sixty sixty six sixty seven bacteria if i'm not mistaken was strapped to my sees hydra scott because at the time of your a novel organism that had never been discovered anywhere else and it's secreted this chemical that was named rapamycin to honor the island where it was discovered rap and neue and this molecule was clearly found to be a very potent anti fungal and that made it every logical choice for a bacteria to have evolved to produce it bacteria is obviously trying to fight a fun guy by inhibiting that through this molecule up the first thought was a this might be the next cure for athletes foot through stories that are really interesting to me from a historical perspective but i won't get into for the sake of time ultimately that drug which almost died a thousand deaths due to lack of interest finally was championed through a guy named surrender seagal who has since passed away and saran single handedly basically figured out utility for this drug but ultimately put it on the map as a drug that found it's ultimate clinical application in organ transplantation as an immune suppressant so in nineteen ninety nine the ft approves this drug for organ transplantation solid organ transplantation and it spends the next decade in relative obscurity i mean this is literally when i was in my residency using this drug amongst a cocktail of others for patients who had received heart transplants a kidney transplants and liver transplants which remain the what we were taken care of fast forward to two thousand nine and a very well done study is published as part of the interventions testing program that looks at the use of rapamycin in a very well documented strain of mice that are far more representative of what happens in biology than the typical strain of mice that are used in a clinical research setting the rest is history basically that study showed more convincingly than any other study in the i t p history that rapamycin extended life in male mice in female mice and most importantly when initiated very late in life a period of time in which no other drug had ever been able to extend life of course this was replicated many many times in the i t p and elsewhere was also replicated in other model systems meaning it wasn't just replicated getting mammals people went back and ask the question how does this drug rapamycin which inhibits am tor how does it work in east in fruit flies in worms which by the way constitute about a billion years of evolution and it turns out that it always seems to work and so it's for all of those reasons that i say wow this is really promising but why can i not say this is proven and the reason i can't say it's proven is we don't yet have sufficient evidence in the organism of interest or the species of interest which is us and the reason for that is that while there have been some interesting studies done in human and will point back to a podcast that i did with like sixteen and joan manic there are clearly short term studies that demonstrate that the differential dosing pattern of rapamycin can actually produce immune augmentation and immune enhancement rather than immune suppression that doesn't quite translate to the question that many of us want to know the answer to which is hey if i take rapamycin intermittently as demonstrated by these shorter human clinical trials will that translate to not just better immune function but a longer life and so absent really good biomarkers for some of these hallmarks of aging i think we still have a ways to go before we could say the following rapper my son is giro protective towards humans and taking rapamycin according to protocol x will add years to human life and presumably improve health spin that's an enormous claim where i say a lot of work still needs to be done and some of that work i think needs to be done in other animal models such as what matt cable and is doing in the dog aging project and some of that work actually is gonna need to be done in humans using biomarkers that have yet to be developed that will be substitutes for some of these more important cellular markers of aging and so i think it's important to because you been open and other podcasts mainly with matt on how you take rapamycin but even though you take it and with are you set on why you think it has promised seen that doesn't mean you necessarily think everyone should just go out and blindly take it not all of your patients are taken in as well correct very few of my patients are taking it i would say i don't think ten percent of our patients are taking rapamycin and the reason for that quite simply is and less a patient is willing to go down the rabbit hole with me on understanding this and understanding the risks and probabilities and the uncertainty i just don't view this is something that is responsible and i've course i know that there are many physicians out there who are giving out rapamycin like it's tic tacs and chocolates and the truth of it is we're not seeing a lot of horrible things happening so clearly in the short run that doesn't appear to be a problem but i also think it's irresponsible to represent that we know that that's going to lengthen life that sort of why i think there's a that of a disconnect in my willingness to have been taking this drug for the past six years and my hesitation in just sort of giving it to anybody who walks in the door moving on to the next topic within your protect drugs metformin where would you place that while i'll say today i would place it in the fuzzy category i actually would have put this in the promising category one hundred episodes ago were going to point people back to a podcast that i did with andrew huber min the last year was a journal club that we did where i talked about what i believe are the two most important large epidemiologic papers that are trying to address this question indirectly and i obviously won't rehash that in all the great detail but these two studies the first one was done in two thousand and fourteen the second one in twenty twenty two i think represent the book ends of an observation that creates a lot of interest and i think this is a great example of where epidemiology is very helpful and twenty fourteen bannister at all published something that at the time was almost impossible to believe i certainly remember reading it in real time i remember getting and embargoed copy before it came out and just really being shocked so the study at the surface looked at people who had type two diabetes who were taking metformin and people who did not have type two diabetes and who are obviously not taking metformin and it asked the question who had a lower all cause mortality rate now of course we know that people with type two diabetes or going to have their lives truncated by an average of six to seven years relative to someone without type two diabetes so you wouldn't think that the addition of metformin to somebody with type two diabetes would materially affect that maybe it would close that gap from six and a half years to four years or something like that but in fact what the study found was no the people taking metformin with type two diabetes actually lived slightly longer than the people who did not in fact there was about a fifteen percent reduction in all cause mortality over a three year follow up period of he says done in an enormous population using the uk biobank dataset so that paper i believe more than any other paper set the stage for the excitement around metformin as a geo protective compound because what's clear is that the diabetics taking metformin still had inferior glycemic control to the non diabetics so in other words if they're living longer it's not because they have better glycemic control it would seem to be that it's they're better because of something else that metformin is doing out side of managing presumably hepatic glucose output now i've had nir barzilai on the podcast twice and will again encourage people who are interested in this to go back and listen to those podcast as well because near has argued that indeed metformin is euro protective and that there are many benefits to metformin that completely transcend it's properties within the liver for glycemic control but i have become less convinced of that and so i think as i talk about in the podcast with andrew i think there were a lot of holes in the banister study and i think they sent her around methodology something called informative censoring where the patients who were in the metformin diabetes arm were censored out of the analysis that demonstrated a reduced mortality if they were lost to follow up or if they had a medication change and usually a medication change on someone who's only taking metformin is meaning that the disease is progressing so you're adding another medication so the problem with that is i think obvious when you realize that you were censoring out people who were sicker and you were actually selecting for the healthiest possible people not to mention the fact that you're also not doing this in a randomized fashion and i cover all of that detail elsewhere so the follow up study which was done by keys at all and twenty twenty two basically sought to improve on the methodology of the banister paper and it did something quite clever which is it repeated the analysis using a different patient cohort so it's a danish patient population covert but it's set up to studies within the study one very similar to what the banister experiment was and then one using a set of twins who deferred only in that one had diabetes in one didn't that's a clever design and it's hard to do and they actually found the opposite they found exactly what you would expect to find which is whether you are talking about identical twins fraternal twins unrelated people if you had type two diabetes even if you were on metformin your risk of mortality was significantly higher and it varied anywhere from thirty three percent higher to eighty percent higher depending on the cove varied analysis and the cohort there was being looked at again this was much more consistent with what one expect this is i think a better analysis for several reasons here's what's most interesting on it they actually went and then did and informative censoring analysis to see if indeed informative censoring was exclusively responsible for the result in the banister paper and it turned out it wasn't in other words even when they repeated that methodology they still produced the finding you would expect in addition to this i think the other reason i would continue to keep metformin in a fuzzy category as opposed to a promising category at this point in remember fuzzy doesn't mean it doesn't work fuzzy means we need more data to upgrade is that metformin has failed in the eye tp will link to both of the podcast with rich miller where we talk about the i t p in detail and why the i teepees are such impressive studies and why so few molecules have succeeded in the i t p but metformin is not one of them in fact the only time metformin to my recollection has ever been positive been an atp was when it was combined with wrap up my son but metformin alone did not succeed whereas other drugs such as can i get flows in a car bows rapamycin have succeeded so i don't want to go into much further because again this content exists elsewhere and i just want to really focus people on the high level my view today is that metformin is in the fuzzy category one of the thing i should say is that there is a study that is eventually getting funded in fact it might i mean technically i guess it it is funded i don't know if it's began enrollment yet called the tame study and the tame study is going to attempt to answer this question in humans by studying disease onset in susceptible but otherwise healthy individuals and that's why i think it's safe to say that look whether it's episode four hundred or episode five hundred we are definitely going to be talking about metformin again yeah definitely and kind of going down the germ protect their we talk about rapper talked about metformin next when we get ass about all the time is an id also when we've covered in various podcast but looking at an id how would you put it into a category when we talk about any d we're really talking about multiple things were talking about any d itself but i'm also speaking a little bit more broadly on talking about precursors because any d can't be taken orally it can be given intravenously when there are lots of clinics out there the do that but from a practical standpoint we tend to look at things that you can take orally so we really tend to be talking about an hour and and a man which are oral precursors that become converted into and a d but again let's just provide just a touch of context here right so any d is discovered more than a hundred years ago and over time i think people come to sort of understand it's a very important signaling molecule it's a very important part of cellular metabolism oh and by the way it declines with age so now you have this thing that super interesting and super relevant and completely ubiquitous and as we age it goes down so understandably and the early two thousands it became a very high interest topic bit further became of interest when it became linked to something called sir to and which i mean to talk about intimate so basically sir to ins are proteins that require any de de de a subtle ways lysine residues which is just fancy chemical talk for it changes the modification of an amino acid but this is something that occurs so much and is so important to maintaining dna integrity and managing oxidative stress that basically there were two hypotheses broadly speaking one hypothesis is the reason and a d levels decline with age is because dna damage goes up with age that's true we know that that's true so are those two causally related is the rise in dna damage with age driving an increase in any d utilization in that's why in it he is going down or are these uncoupled his dna damage going up with age which it is and is any d abundance going down with age for a separate reason and oh if we only had more any d we could offset more dna damage i think it's safe to say we don't yet know the answer to that but nevertheless i think the cottage industry around and eighty has come up which says look we know the answer to this or at least we're going to postulate that the answer is of course and eighty is going down with age and whether or not that's causal are not giving more and eighty is going to be a better thing okay so what did the data have to say and again this is an area where i mean there is a remarkably booming industry around the administration of any d and it's precursors it's actually surprising how little data is out there so what i thought i would do is try to highlight perhaps the most promising data i could see and hopefully by sharing why that's not so promising or why that's really really small you might be convinced of my view which i should have said at the outset as i kind of think this and a d stuff is noise at the moment i'm putting us in a category even below fuzzy but to be clear i'm not putting it in the nonsense category what that means is there may still be clinical scenarios under which this make sense even if it is not juror protective get very important distinction her gonna talk about a couple of studies in neurodegenerative disease one in l as one in parkinson's disease that are both so small and quite frankly just so i want to be disparaging to the studies but not amazing studies but reasonable first attempts at looking that maybe there's something there and may be in these scenarios there is a benefit but again we're asking this through the lens of duro protection were really asking the question in this context of hey if i take a bunch of any d or bunch of and eighty precursors such as an hour and a man am i going to live longer or even live significantly better and again i think the answer that question is noise so the a less study gave patients pretty high dose of a combination drug of nikitin him i'd right beside so and are and terrorist still been a for four months and then it's followed basically symptoms of a ls on a functional scale so unfortunately for anybody who has known a patient with a ls or a family member anything i got an id ids it's top three most debilitating diseases in the history of our species and unfortunately there is no cure and the end is just very tragic and and decide what this study was basically asking is look can we delay this in any way shape or form and the short answer is at least on one of the functional scales of progression the answer appeared that yes this compound of nicotine am i'd and terrorist ill been actually delayed progression by a short period of time for these patients now again this was a very small study clearly this would be a phase one study so first and foremost you're just making sure hey there's no toxicity which there wasn't and you're basically saying is there any smoke anywhere that makes me think there's a fire i believe there is a phase two trial on going and my hope is that the phase two trial is significantly larger has robust and puts and therefore can shed light on this question because let's be clear if there is a compound out there that can keep a patient off a ventilator longer when they have a alas or can prevent secretion issues longer or respiratory distress longer by all means that's a very important thing to know the other study i would reference is also a very small study that was done in twenty patients with parkinson's disease ten were put on make it into my right beside ten on a placebo for four weeks and it saw some change in one of the movement disorder rating scales that's used to subjectively quantify movement in patients with pd but there's a bit of a catch because there was a confound or in that some of those patients were closer in their last dose to leave of dopa which is a medication that in the early stages of the disease is quite effective at improving movement it was not a very well done study and i think the most charitable thing one could say about that study is look at maybe suggests that there something they're worth looking at but i don't think that that would even rise to the level of being as compelling as the standard therapies that are used for patients with parkinson's disease there's one other study that looked at m c i believe mild cognitive impairment and it looked at any d use i believe it was studying some aspects of memory and physical function it showed some improvements in physical function which again would not be the primary concern for mc i but it did not show any improvement in cognitive impact by the way it might mean that there is an improvement in cognitive impact but not over such a short time frame the test because it was a phase one study was too small to actually see a signal you weren't powered to see a signal which by the way is not always the case in a phase one where do i land on all this i think that the evidence that any d and it's precursors is gere oh protective meaning we're going to take a bunch of people who don't have disease and we're going to make them live longer i think this is a very very low probability but not zero and again i think the probability we're not going to be talking about this one in in another hundred episodes is pretty low in the spirit of well how much do i believe in this i don't take these compounds a don't take any d infusions i don't take and are i don't take any man and it's certainly not because there isn't an abundance of those things out there but that by guess tells you my level of confidence in this rounding out the kind of gerard protective drug category is the final one weekend osman a lot which is resveratrol so where would you rank that and kind of how do you think about that compared to the three we've talked about so far i have to be honest with you i was really surprised when you guys sent me the list that resveratrol was on it because the implication is that it had been asked a nerf in that survey we put out there that people wanted to hear it and all i have to say is wow i'm amazed people are still talking about resveratrol this is absolute nonsense i'm just saying we're gonna put this in the nonsense category and we never need to talk about this again in other words there is not just an absence of evidence there's actually evidence of absence here so resveratrol is a phenol it's a chemical that activates sir to ends so understandably in all the early two thousand hoopla around sir to ends which we just talked about a second ago the view was like oh my god sir to windsor good the repairing dna damage resveratrol is an activator of sir to and that's gotta be good away we go a landmark study quote unquote in two thousand and six garnered an unbelievable amount of attention now i think the attention was just as much from the fact that in miniscule amounts resveratrol is found in red wine it wasn't just that are we have another molecule that in some obscure mouse model may be seems to extend life i think it was oh and by the way this molecule at about one one hundredth the level is found in red wine on a serious level is this an explanation for the french paradox oh click bait level does this mean we should be drinking as much wine as possible that's the only explanation neck i have for why this story gathered traction and why it continues to this day to cloud the judgment of folks but as we've covered in great detail on the podcast the first episode with rich miller the two thousand six mouse resveratrol study was at best misinterpreted so there was indeed a longevity benefit but it's a very obscure model right so is a mouse model where the mice were fed a diet of sixty percent coconut oil i can't imagine what that would be like for ten minutes let alone for the duration of a mouse his life especially when we consider mice or herbivores that wouldn't be eating coconut oil they're not eating that much fat you have these mice and sixty percent coconut oil diet and the cause of death was so much fat accumulation in the liver that the liver expanded into the hemi thorax and collapsed their lungs so again usually when we do experiments with mice they die based on their genetic predilection to die of cancer and were typically trying ask the question hey like him his rapamycin like a good rapper my son to these mice they get less cancer than these mice what nadeau here where force feeding them coconut oil to turn their livers into big blobs of fat that expand into their chest and compressed their lungs and it turned out that under those conditions there was a longer time to death on average median lifespan if they were on resveratrol than if they were not turn up by the way there's no difference in maximum lifespan so you didn't shift to the curve of mortality fro the top ten percent of mice you just shifted it for the median mice somehow that generated all of the interest in this drug and very few people paid attention when the i t p came along and said we're going to study this really really rigorously we're going to study this in mice that are not current a genetic mutants and we're not gonna force feed them fat we're gonna give the normal mouse food and watch them die of normal mouse deaths and bit made no difference so they gave them three hundred milligrams of resveratrol per kilo of food which is three hundred ppm again just for comparison say guys wine is like less than two ppm parts per million the first marriage while they're giving them three hundred ppm and nothing happened now the folks who say resveratrol works have criticized that study saying the bioavailability is low and therefore you need much much much more than the three hundred ppm that was given in that study but again that was a concern and a criticism that was only voiced after the study that proponents of resveratrol were involved in that study and they signed off the run the paper mean this was their view so i just have a hard time believing that there is any value in raspberry trawl that's why i don't take it independent the fact that it's still a ubiquitous compound that's found everywhere yeah i think that wraps those four different drugs in that my think that's why sometimes it's nice hopefully for people when you cover a variety and you can see how they fit and different bucket some kind of i think about it and again even you highlighting where your opinions changed and where it may change again and the next hundred episodes depending on new science and so looking into the next category which kind of is a little more focused around exercise i thought to be helpful the maybe start with a few anchoring things that you talk about often and just so people can kind of understand where you put the or to max that's importance and muscle mass and that's importance on the scale and so obviously we don't have to get into these because there is an insane amount of content on those but if you had to summarize quickly where you would rank them on the scale that we're doing today where would you put b o two max where would you put the importance of muscle mass and badly with muscle mass i would put muscle strength because we really think about some as as a proxy for strength but i would say that those are the two closest things you could put a proven they would be right up there with smoking cessation they would be right up there with blood pressure management you can't prove anything in biology but boy the probability that having a high vo to max hi muscle mass and hi muscle strength are going to increase the length of your life and improve the quality of your life that probability is so high that to act in disregard of that is irresponsible that's what i really mean by proven so what can i say very little on this topic i have not expounded on both on his podcast and on others and social media i mean this is a topic i can't say enough about because the magnitude of the effects is so much greater than everything else and you can see nick why i get animated and why i get phosphor related when people ask me about resveratrol and sir to and activators and any d and and are and they're not exercising or there exercising but their exercise is totally jv and it's like wait a minute you are picking up pennies in front of a steam train fighting over basis points of theoretical possible benefits of something and you're completely missing this other thing over here and you know you've heard me tease folks including patience and time and say look once you get your via to max here and your muscle mass year in your strength year then we can talk about the thirty seven supplements that you're interested in taking i don't know nick how much more do want me to say that i haven't already said no i think that's good and mobile link to it and the shown out to all the other places i think sometimes it's helpful for people or at least even myself included as understanding where these things rank and how they compared to others which you had a really important point where to yeah i've heard you say over and over and over internal or external wedges if you're worried about taking all these job productive drugs and you wanna take em that's your prerogative but if you think that's gonna save you from needing to exercise needing to have muscle strength needing to have a higher v or to max it maybe is not the best risk mitigation strategy and i think how you look at all this is how can you mitigate the risk of not being capable of having a longer life span but also even more importantly a better health spare yep i do say a lot that even if exercise had no effect on lifespan to it was lifespan neutral or be more dramatic even if exercise slightly shorten your life span by a year it's undoubtedly worth it for the improvement in the quality of your life both physically and cognitively and in many cases emotional him and we that's a much harder one to quantify but i think that's their and i guess the other point i will make to bring it back is like why is it that vo to max muscle mass and strength stand out as the greatest predictors of lifespan which they do these stand out as far greater predictors of lifespan than cholesterol levels blood pressure blood glucose all of these things that clearly relate to how fast you're gonna live or die even smoking there's a worse predictor of lifespan then your fitness level and the reason i think is just it speaks to how potent exercises as a tool to impact the cellular processes of aging the but it also speaks to the fact that you can't cram for the test when it comes to these tests so if a person has a high vo to max they have been doing a lot of exercising for a long time there's enough mean their whole life but they didn't just decide a a week ago oh man kind of unfit but i'm i'm gonna start exercising and i'm gonna get fit no no no if you're via to max's in the top two or three percent of your age group you've been at this for awhile therefore the vo to max measurement is really an integration of work that you have done and the same is true for muscle mass and more importantly for muscle strength these things like why his grip strength always comes up is this incredible predictor of mortality is it because being able to squeeze things with your hand is especially important be a there's probably some edge cases but it's what does it imply if you have high grip strength you didn't just wake up and have high grip strength by definition you have been lifting and carrying heavy things you have been using your hands aggressively manipulating things carrying squeezing all of these things polling and it's that work that is being captured through the integral of the final metric or the test we morgan into it too much here but one of the questions we are as good as does by people over populations fifty plus is it too late for me to start exercising and we have a special absurd that will be coming out in a few weeks dedicated to that so for those of you who are maybe haven't been exercising you're wondering how to start and you are in that order category where you don't want to get hurt that will be a really good resource they're moving to the next topic something we get asked about especially after the podcast we did with jeremy monarchy which is blood flow restriction and i think when you look at the muscle mass muscle strength sometimes people are dealing with injury sometimes people maybe don't want to lift heavy weights in their kind of dealing with various orthopedic injuries whatever it could be how do you think about blood for restriction and where would you rank that in this ranking system i put be a foreign the promising category then again it depends on how you define the question but is the question does using bfr and higher reps lower load weights produce superior results to the same wraps the same way it's without bfr it's promising slash proven that is clearly the case so again just kind of backing up for a little bit and for those who didn't hear the podcast on this or who need a little refresher so this is a topic that became of interest not that long ago right may be in the last twenty five years or so when it was demonstrated that if you applied a tourniquet around a limb as it was exercising you would see superior improvements in strength and muscle size relative to and and turn a kid limb again provided they were both doing the same amount of work so the question is why perhaps so why is it that applying a tourniquet well anybody who's done bfr can tell you it's not very comfortable so when you impair venus return slightly and that's really the goal of blood flow restriction it's not complete occlusion it's partial occlusion you are allowing the accumulation of metabolites at a much higher rate some more lactic acid is pulling more metabolites of metabolism beyond that and the thought is that something about that is creating more of a stress signal then would otherwise be present absent the tourniquet and so an immediate use case became won't look can we use far lighter weights but produce the still a profound amount of discomfort and then the obvious place where this showed up of course is around injury so when a person is injured let's use my example when i had shoulder surgery i wanted to be able to still exercise that arm but for months after surgery i could not carry for example a barbell that was the same way that i would have carried before right i'm still too much pressure on the humorous in it's newly repaired joint around the labour i'm so what if i used a third of the weight that i might have previously used i'll do a lot more wraps but i'll create this blood flow restriction around it and i experience of much higher training affect the data have largely born this out and the nice thing about these studies by the way this is what makes this type of research really elegant is every patient can be their own control because you're doing limb isolation so it's a little goofy for the patient because you're gonna have one leg that my get bigger stronger than the other but every patient can be their own control and so the analyses the studies and the met analyses and jeremy lin a key who was the podcast guess we're talking about i think did a large met analysis in two thousand limit it showed that if you look at low load resistance training in be a far without bfr it clearly results in greater muscle strength and hypertrophy improvements it's not subtle these are really pretty big affects all of that said nick there's still a question that i don't think we know the answer to which is how does bfr training at higher reps lower weight compared to non bfr training with higher weight and presumably lower reps and that's a much harder head to head to design because the question is how do you design the protocol in each because now you've broken one of the constants that have been preserved across all of these studies and so i think that the answer there is still unknown as such i just wouldn't recommend that somebody exclusively rely on bfr for slots not that comfortable and you can't do it for everything it's very limb centric but even if you were just to talk about restricting it to how you train your arms and your legs i still think there are lots of scenarios we're using bfr doesn't make sense and my personal use of be a far which i've talked about the as i really like to use it as finishers in do some sort of upper body finishers and lower body finishers on upper body and lower body days respectively but it's not really like the bulk of what i'm doing so that's kind of how i feel about this and again i think it is disproportionately useful in the case and setting of a person who is rehabbing something and it's a great would we use it so liberally with our patients as we're trying to get them moving immediately post surgical intervention and we want to do it with i mean even just using their body weight so for example a patient that had knee surgery the minute we get permission from the surge and we've got them doing leg extensions with just the way to their leg but doing it with the bfr cuff to there's actually a training effect in the quads but without overloading the knee because clearly you wouldn't want to post knee surgery put a strain from the patellar tendon beneath in the attachment for people interested in learning more willing to podcast but if people wanna try it do you wanna let people know which brand you use and obviously you can say to you have no affiliation with them we don't get paid by them or anything it's just one you've tried a lot of a newfound real enjoying them with it yet i use a brand called katsu i used to different types of katsu devices and i apologize i don't remember the exact name but one of them is like maybe it's called the see three and it's might sort of bread and butter go to one where i put the armbands on put the like bands on whichever i'm using inflated to the pressure and then go exercise and then they have another one that i really quite like but it does what are called passive cycles of i'm just sort of trying to recover you put this on i think it does like a twenty second inflate hold deflate repeat the from sitting at the computer like i've got this thing cycling on my arms or on my legs and the if nothing else honestly it just feels great like i really actually enjoy the feeling of it so yeah those are the devices that i use and there is a real art to this there's a clinical way that you want to be able to go about doing this where it's not just put a tourniquet on which is what i used to do and hope for the best because you have to make sure the pressure is such that you are still allowing both blood in and blood out you're just trying to blunt that someone it is always fun and when we hop on zoom calls with people who aren't internal and you do have those things cycling because it really does make people wonder what's going on over there and one for is wrong with this guy attach their unfair and fits your brand the so how is say it's on brown when you're doing that and when you're just chop and on venice and sticks and millions to it's also on brown so the next one something we get asked by the time it's come up on a few podcast with on baron adam cohen looking at the upper body lower body but stem cells so how are you thinking currently about stem cells this is an area where i think it's really complicated i'm gonna put this somewhere between noise and fuzzy i'm talking about it through one application for this purpose which is osteoarthritis which is where it's been most talked about in most studied in animals i want to reiterate that right so i still find it very plausible that there are arenas in which stem cells could be beneficial and i would say there are actually scenarios under which i would take stem cells if i had a certain injury so if i tore my rotator cuff and it was a marginal call as to whether it was surgical i would absolutely start with a stem cell injection if it could mean avoiding surgery and waiting for repair and i would love nothing more neck than to see an actual randomized clinical trial that takes patients who have torn their rotator cuff again let's try to take people with comparable injuries and randomized them into three groups stem cell injection surgical repair nonsurgical repair rehab we can debate the merits of each of these approaches but i would really love to see that provided there was a way to create a uniform protocol around what it means to get stem cells in many ways that's what has been hampering this field i believe to be clear the ft a does not authorize the use of stem cell so all of this is existing either outside the united states where it's not regulated by the f d a or it's sort of there's some sort of grey areas where it can be done but it's obviously not covered by insurance really these other things and again if you're presumably using by i'm not even sure how much these protocols are using autologous stem cells versus the some cells of others and the total lack of consistency in what the actual agent is the actual stem cell is a big part of what makes this very challenging and i would struggle with that my so if i were in that situation i just described where i tore my rotator cuff and i was at least willing to consider doing this before surgery the hardest part i would have is where am i going to do this who do i trust because it's not like i can look at someone's data and draw conclusions right you're basically looking at a bunch of marketing material not actual data so i would say when we talk about osteoarthritis lead least we have the advantage that there are like canine models have osteoarthritis where they've looked at stem cells and the truth of it is they have mixed results some of them have shown that dogs with osteoarthritis when injected with stem cells do tend to improve their gate do tend to see a reduction in les mis which again is partially assessed by gate partially assessed by the use of medications or pain relief through medications and other studies have found no benefits whatsoever again it's hard to tease out what that means does it mean that the methodologies are flawed and that in some of these studies they're not actually using the right stem cells against themselves a very broad term what are we really talking about we talk about a player he potent stem cell are we talking about a donor derived stem cell are we talking about a fetal derived stem self by the way then i haven't even got into like what's the concentration of stem cells what's the protocol how many injections do you need like all of this stuff is still unclear and as a result of that we have a cottage industry that is the absolute wild west i think it's unfortunate i wish there was greater financial incentive to study for what the answer is as opposed to just a yeah we know the answer it works or we know the answer this is a total sham it shouldn't be done when in reality that truth might be somewhere there's like it's very hard to have this above noise right now because of a total absence of data not because there isn't biological plausibility the really is but it's just there's no data so i clearly i'm not going to call is nonsense but this is not gonna rise to the level of promising in my mind yet moving on to the next category or theme which is loosely nutrition which is something we know how much you want to talk about and it's also something where i think as we go through these you can kind of not only give your opinion on where you're at now but also maybe how that's changed over time and so first and foremost what we see the most is questions around long term fasting and it's potential benefits on longevity so not fasting to count calories anything of that nature but more so how you think about cornered what long term fasting as it relates to born germany you know it's so funny when you and josh and the team put this list in front of me the other day and i got through the first few and i was like ah sweet and off to talk about nutrition and then i came to this big block of nutrition and i just wanted to start crying or did you guys deliberately barry this way you don't want to have it too early so that your mood goes down right away but we also on how we get asked about a ton people are very interested in nutrition and i need to spend more time with my therapist understanding why i hate talking about nutrition because i do think i have a lot to say on it and i actually think i'm knowledgeable on the subject and i know that therefore i should talk about it because i can add value in a sea of bad information but the visceral response it produces in me neck it's difficult for me to quantify actually i've already forgotten your question that's how much i'm just in the throes of pain at the moment long term fasting okay i'm gonna call this fuzzy and two year priming earlier i mean to tell you this is an area where i've seen an enormous change in my point of view over the past three hundred episodes so by way of disclosure some people assume this podcast might know that and there are many people and sure who are listening this podcast who came into the orbit of our work through my work in the fasting space so for me fasting has historically been a very important part of my thinking about how to live longer how to use fasting is a juror protective tool again i think a little bit of historical context is relevant here we spoke earlier about rapamycin which stands alone in the pantheon of molecules the only molecule the only molecule that is universally extended life across all model systems of you carry out switch span one billion years of evolution that's a big deal where we shouldn't forget that there is one intervention non drug intervention that has also done that and it did it long before then that was fasting or caloric restriction so there's clearly something magical going on with caloric restriction when it comes to he long gating life but the question is can we extend that into humans and perhaps the more important question is what with the fasting protocol be and i wrote a piece on this a long time ago that maybe we should link to where i say look the question is how long should you fast to what extent should you fast and how frequently should you repeat the fast those are basically your three variables and there are obviously so many combinations of as i won't even say infinite because you could just draw a line in the sand and say you could do a complete fast you could do a fifty percent faster seventy five percent fat than just make it in a somewhat big an arbitrary and you could do it for one day or three days or five days and you could do at once a year or once a quarter once a month like even if you took reasonable spots it quickly becomes impossible to test all of these and so instead what we're left with is a cult of personality is where people tell you what they do and i've been guilty of that although i hope i've always been clear at saying i have no clue if this is quote unquote right when i was doing was doing seven to ten days of water only fasting once a quarter and then three days once a month on the alternative so two months short fast one month that along fast repeat now what data could i point to for that protocol none absolutely not i made it up again literally made that up and quit again very transparently made that up where things happening in my body from a cellular level that were beneficial probably that i have great biomarkers to show that know because i was relying on very standard biomarkers or mean fortunately my standard biomarkers are generally quite good so it's not like the yes your glucose is gonna go down your key turns go up your insulin goes down a little bit but those things are transient and by the way a lot of things got really bad when you fast it right your thyroid function completely deteriorated your androgen function completely deteriorated so it wasn't like all good but what was really interesting is the thing we couldn't measure which was what was actually happening to those hallmarks of aging were we improving at the cellular level things like senescence a toff edgy all of those things well guess what we can't measure those things are we don't know we can try to extrapolate and there was some rationale in my mind i suppose extrapolating from what we knew in mice which is that this many hours of fasting in a mouse does indeed produce cellular changes that are incredibly beneficial to disease prevention and therefore given what we know about their relationship between mice fasting and human fasting it should be that by about five days i'm going to be experiencing some of those benefits but then even if you knew that were true then the question would be will how often do you need to do that so even if you could establish that five days was a sufficient length of time to fast should you do at five days a month five day the quarter five days a year no idea so you as the question why did i stop my fasting protocol and for me it really came down to two things but i think the most important was that i just ago kind of look at the data the bigger data of myself and realized over the course of three years i had lost can't remember the exact number but it was getting close to twenty pounds of muscle might even sixteen pounds of muscle over that period of time at least at the frequency that i was fasting which i'm not saying was right or wrong it's very difficult to gain back the lean muscle you keep losing you lose a ton you regain some of it you lose a ton you regain some of it but i just couldn't dig out of that hole and so i think it around twenty twenty one i said you know what i'm going to just put the kibosh on fasting for now i'm a make sure again back twenty pounds of muscle that i have lost a against my personal story with it unfortunately i would still say neck that and again i'm glad you separated this out and said look as fasting a viable tool for weight loss short it's one of the tools we have in the c or d r t r kit and by the way in that regard i still do it by the way when we meet also established i am still a tr guy for the most part drink my coffee in the morning i will slug a protein shake in the morning that is very low in calories because it's just proteins which can be one hundred and twenty two hundred fifty calories but i don't eat a meal until two o'clock in the afternoon and then i have dinner at six or seven but again i'm doing that for caloric restriction purposes i'm doing that to manage total caloric intake not because i think that there's some magical benefit that i'm getting by not having meals spread throughout the day i guess just to put a bow on this topic why is this fuzzy or i think it's fuzzy because in many ways this suffers the same problem rapamycin suffers in terms of getting into much more dispositive clinical trials which is were clearly never going to do the experiment that asks people to undergo different fasting protocols for the entirety of their life to determine if indeed they live longer too we're going to have to come up with better proxies meaningful biomarkers of the hallmarks of aging if we can do that then maybe we can start to get a sense of whether or not rapamycin and fasting should be important parts of our armamentarium as we think about ways to impact those hallmarks of aging to follow up question their one of which is you mention those kind of two things are cause you to change your mind the first was the muscle loss and just that what was the second the second one is actually was just more of a social issue which was at the time that i was fasting i also happen to be traveling a lot it was very easy for me to fast when i was away from home to all of those fasts were done while i was in new york and i live in san diego so i didn't have to be fasting around anybody i was just fasting in my apartment alone can even if i went out to dinner with friends which was weird but i did i would just sit there and drink soda water while they were eating dinner jacket famously tells a story about that one night but once i stop traveling it meant both all those faster gonna have to be done at home and i still wanna do it i don't want my kids to be wondering like why his daddy never eating and all i can stuff so that became another reason independent the biology to the second follow up would be any kind of hinted at their which was you would love to have biomarkers to know if it's working at what dose how that works but what would have to be true or what would have to change outside of that if there's anything that would cause you to start fasting again long term i don't know i would really need to see something incredibly compelling in a higher order model may be in a dog model or something like that going like this is a great example of where i think companion dogs are such a great model to study things because get i think most people find binary fasting far easier than caloric restriction and there's already a lot of controversy around caloric restriction i have an entire chapter on this or not live where i talk about the wisconsin and i a monkey studies but for most people like if i said oh you just got to reduce calories by twenty five percent for the rest your life and you're in a live longer but he would say i don't want to live longer that's torture it's actually easier to say well what if you just have to periodically do big fast i would like to see an experiment of that done in a better model than just mice definitely looking at the next topic to be work a star grayson for podcast started to topic that we get asked about an insane amount which is the energy balance theory then we've had tons of guess on who maybe have different opinions on this at something that you've written about a lot but how do you think about that energy balance theory right now as it relates to the ranking system again i put this right between promising and proven truthfully so again i think it's worth stating what we're talking about so the energy balance theory i believe would pass it can i don't live in this world at the moment so i want to be very sensitive to those who doesn't i don't want to misrepresented so if i am misrepresenting as i hope i hear about it but what it's basically saying is that that energy balance is determined solely by the caloric density of the food's consumed less the energy expenditure and that the caloric density the net available caloric density of of food is it's contribution to energy balance so this is where again i feel a little bit bad talking about this because i haven't been as diligent as maybe i should be in staying up on this world over the past decade i've largely not paid attention to it truthfully because in many ways i've sort of seen what i believe is a reasonable answer and just for folks to maybe don't know part of history here i'm in i was once running an organization that funded research directly to try to answer this question and i think i went into that thinking the answer was going to be one thing but actually very excited to see regardless a swing at this and i think that that study while it it had some flaws actually came out and showed something else which was if indeed iso caloric manipulations of macro nutrients change energy expenditure it's not an enormous difference who does that mean in english if you give to people equally caloric diet that are radically different in macronutrients do you have a significant difference in energy expenditure that's what was being tested by that theory and i think that the evidence is much more clearly in favor of the fact that know you do not now was at a couple of caveats there is clearly differences in the thermal genesis of food so a thousand calories a protein thousand calories a fat and a thousand calories of carbohydrates are going to have different processing amounts of energy that will result in different amounts of net available energy furthermore different types of foods are going to differentially impact appetite and therefore in a free living environment this isn't to say that macronutrients don't matter but what we're really trying to tease out is is there truly a scenario under which a person who's eating three thousand calories have a balanced diet can switch to three thousand calories of a key to jannik diet and have wait melt off them just because they're on a key to jannik diet they somehow magically start burning a lot more energy and again i believe the answer that question is no i do not see any evidence to support that and therefore i think that if a person is on three thousand calories a day of a balanced diet and they switch over to what they believe is three thousand calories a day of akita jannik diet and the weight starts pounding off them i think they're either moving more or eating less than they realize i masses before and i think it's a portable here which is how would you respond to people who maybe get frustrated at your ability to change your mind if new data comes out because i think you mention their you could have people who came and maybe through the fasting content that we'd put out and talked about and now they're here in this which is why i think again i'd like this ranking scale because it allows anchoring to things which is this is how are think about in this is our confidence interval on this is our could go up and down but just in general i think there may be at times and science a resentment if you do change your mind and i think that leads to potentially people sticking with their beliefs maybe longer than they should and so how do you respond to people who say why do you change your mind and should that affect what i hear you say today so for spot that's gonna news to me that people are upset about that i would bet that it's not scientists who are upset at that i think that any scientist who doesn't do that needs to be question so in other words if you can't change your mind in the presence of new data i think by definition you're not a scientist you're an advocate now advocacy has its place but not without science the only thing i would ask of those people if there are people that are indeed upset at me is what would you propose is the alternative is it vexing that i change my mind on things yes i suppose it is if it means that it impacts you are belief about what is good to do what is not to do but if the alternative is i'm confronted with new data but i ignore it or i pay attention to it and i lie about it i can't extract from that what the alternative is that is better than simply being uncomfortable with the fact that yeah i used to believe this thing and i believed it and i lived it and bubble the law but now i'm like yeah i don't i don't believe it anymore another topic in this realm of nutrition that we get asked about a lot and seems there's a ton of confusion and we're going a very simplify it just for this conversation is an idea of like is sugar poison what's your thought on that ah all the hits net greatest hits right now they've been and as the greatest hits us are you can agree to doing these things were going to ask you all the stuff that you traditionally don't wanna talk about on a mass yeah again a very loaded question but i would argue that the question is the premise of the question even logical so what is a poison again poison is a word that speaks to a dose speaks to a frequency speaks to corner city acuteness i mean all of these things right so broadly speaking when i think of a poison i'm thinking is something chronically a poison is it acutely boys are so let's start with something that everybody has in their house acetaminophen tylenol is it a poison i mean doesn't have a skeleton on the cover with like bones through it right immediate doesn't look like that dray know you have under your sink that is clearly marked as a poison tells you to take five hundred to a thousand milligrams every four to six hours or whatever the instructions are but what happens if you took twenty grams of that stuff twenty times the dose while he would be dead of liver failure and three days if someone wasn't able to pump your stomach and time or get you a liver transplant so that sounds like a poison that's actually acutely quite toxic is alcohol a poison depends on the dose we've talked about and written about this at great length there are clearly doses it which alcohol is quite toxic it's neurotoxic and again there's certainly a scenario where you know you have a glass of wine a few times a week and it would be almost impossible to discern or measure a negative effect of that so i say all of those things just to kind of anchor people in what we're talking about and i think this type of word i just think that the phrase sugar is poison is not helpful it's loaded it's emotional it's sort of nonsensical what we should really be asking i think is a question that's more along the lines of what are the biochemical effects of sucrose her high fructose corn syrup or fructose in general at different doses and under different metabolic conditions and understandably that's a mouthful that nobody wants to say so she is easier to just sugars poison but again i think this is an area where my view has changed quite a bit and it's changed because of the data i just don't see the data to demonstrate that an iso caloric substitution of fructose for glucose is demonstrably worse for health outcomes if total energy intake is preserved now does that mean that eating sugar in an unrestricted manner in a free living environment is of no consequence know it doesn't mean that at all and it certainly appears that in at least a susceptible individual a high consumption of fructose and it seems even more clear in liquid fructose can drive a pet it of behavior meaning to put that in english if you're drinking a lot of sugar it makes you want to eat more calories now we can debate how many calories and i believe that these data have been misrepresented i think that these data have been misrepresented and overstated i think that in a free living environment people will consume more energy if they have more access to sugar but if you control for calories you may recall i had this discussion on the podcast with rick johnson using what i think was probably one of the most robust experiments i had seen on this topic given how long it lasted and my recollection was it lasted nine months which in mice is an eternity under iso caloric conditions when these mice were fed when their total calories were controlled and you had high fructose vs low for those groups you did not see a statistically significant difference in bodyweight that's a big deal now would you see a statistically significant difference in metabolic parameters i think you might if the fructose dose gets high enough but this comes back to something i said at the outset the dose makes the poison what appears to be the case to me is that i don't think we know yet what that dose looks like as a function of the other parameters so when i was young when i was a teenager and i trained six hours a day which i did i never ran less than eight miles in the morning i mean i was in the gym like it was a training machine there's no way i was eating fewer than two hundred grams of sugar a day a i mean i just ate everything that was in front of me i would drink two liters of orange juice as my snack box other kids were drinking little juice boxes i had a two liter can of orange juice i didn't eat bowls of cereal i ate them a box at a time so was i unhealthy no chance at probably had four percent body fat but i was exercising six hours a day so the context matters if i ate that much food today nevermind sugar i mean you wouldn't even know my name anymore i'd be dead so everything about this is problematic because i think people want to focus on just one macro nutrient in this case for ctos or sugar as a molecule and we don't want to sort of focus on the overall dietary pattern that accompanies it and so i would say the following of are we gonna try to some this up when i consume fructose which i do all the time it's generally in the form of fruit i don't restrict my consumption of fruit i generally don't drink calories outside of protein shakes those happen to be sweetened with artificial sweeteners anyway these days they're mostly like sucralose and things like that if i'm drinking a beverage the once or twice a month that i want kind of a carbonated beverage that sweet it's a diet dr pepper as opposed to a doctor pepper okay with the doctor pepper kill me know but again i'm only have like one a month so probably doesn't matter but truthfully neck that's more because of my teeth like what i really care more about is not putting an overall strain on my teeth than i do in the belief that sugar is somehow uniquely poisonous so i guess i do limit sugar intake what you're hearing me kind of react to is not because i think sugar is poison i think a high sugar diet is just a dietary pattern that is in can grew and with eating the right kinds of foods that are generally want to eat anyway i hope that makes sense and is not too awfully but i'll let you push back on know i think it does and i think even though you've talked about the so much i think and we can link to it where you go in more detail by think it would be helpful for people just how you look at nutrition do want to give your quick to buy to framework of metabolic the healthy or unhealthy not obese or kind of adding paints a bigger picture on why you don't just look at sugar been toxic poison whatever it is but how you can a lot more holistic like as i think a lot of what you said there would relate to you because you are metabolically healthy in you know where you sit not to buy to framework but if your patients who maybe i'm metabolic lee unhealthy and they need to lose weight they need to increase or muscle mass you might not be sold liberal with the sugar for them yeah and i'll say this like there's definitely an area where i'm still actively trying to investigate this and will even be doing a podcast on this topic right which is is there a unique role that fructose plays in the development of now for the so non alcoholic fatty liver disease is obviously running rampant right now in the world and one hypothesis is that it's not just energy imbalance which is clearly associated with novelty other to take a person but now for the and they lose twenty pounds the fatty liver is going to get better no matter what but then the question is should those people be restricting fructose and again lots a great mechanistic data for why fructose rather than glucose would disproportionately play a role in the development of national the and i think there's even more compelling evidence for why liquid fructose is potentially playing a greater role but what i haven't seen yet is a really compelling clinical trial that can demonstrate that independent of weight loss iso caloric substitution of fructose for glucose results in an improvement of now for the that said if i have patience with now for the we're going to tell them not to drink alcohol and not to consume fructose out of mild amounts of fruit so we get were making a recommendation that is not necessarily one for which we would have incredible evidence but were saying look even if nothing else that change in behavior reduces in less caloric intake which losses else and weight loss ultimately that's what we care about just her and that little piece do you want to just walk through your to buy to framework for nutrition again will link to places you talk about more detail but i think it's just helpful for people who maybe aren't familiar to have that anchoring yeah i mean it's really three questions and it's is a person over nourished are undernourished that's determined by total amount of body fat and visceral fat or the adequately muscled or under muscled looking at things like fat free mass index or up and accurately mass index and there they metabolic the healthy or not so by understanding the answer to those questions you pretty quickly can come up with a point of view on how a person needs to train and how a person needs to eat and maybe even in some cases how you want to tweak their macro nutrients i think if you talk about sugar you also talk about sugar substitutes cause it's something that we've written about a lot there was studies that have come out that caught a town of press and so how do you think about the idea of sugar substitutes and if they are dangerous i would absolutely refer people back to one of our premium news letters on this topic i think it's one of our best premium newsletters ever it was maybe a bit long for people but again if you really want to get into serious topics you have to get serious the long and short of it is like sugar substitutes have been around for an awfully long time and certainly in the seventies and even as recently as last twenty years there have been concerns around the toxicity of them especially kind of the oh gee ones which would be aspartame and saccharin the truth of it is though i think if you really want to talk about that type of toxicity the doses of the sugar substitutes are literally orders of magnitude greater than what would be consumed by humans so even though there were maybe flaws in some of those studies even if you were to take them at face value it's hard to imagine so for example their study the rat study that got everybody worried about saccharin with rats the developed tumors were being fed the equivalent of eight hundred diet sodas for every day of their life that's how much saccharin those rats were being fed to develop these liver tumors and again i think it's just it's a very slippery slope to then say oh well then these things are poisonous because it sort of like by that logic i mean i told you that even if you took twenty times the dose of tylenol you'd be dead and by the way you'd be dead like much quicker than you would die from this cancer and here we're talking about eight hundred times the ddos over the entire duration of a life you know that level just to be glib neck like oxygen is toxic to people right we have twenty one percent oxygen in the air that were breathing if i put you in a one hundred percent oxygen environment indefinitely the amount of free radicals you would develop would kill you so everything gets toxic at some point the aspartame data i think was a little less extreme basically this was a paper in two thousand sixty thousand seven and it did look at higher rates of cancer in rats that consumed pretty high amounts of aspartame from the day they were born right on to the duration of their life but truthfully they were still consuming the equivalent of twenty cans of diet soda every single day to get to some of those outcomes so is it possible that these things are cancer causing at normal doses it it is possible i don't think it's that probable and therefore when i think about sugar substitutes i'm less concerned with the cancer stuff and more concerned with the metabolic stuff the impact on got health and those other things then so i it's probably worth spending a minute on as opposed to you know worrying too much more about some of these animal models that are using non physiologic doses of those so where we want to start him and i think the two biggest barriers to talk about with non sugar sweeteners is what is the impact on body weight and what does the impact on glycemic controller metabolic health and i would say that the first generation versions of these so saccharin aspartame sucralose seem to have a slightly negative effect on those parameters when calories are controlled conversely the i don't know newer ones some of them that are not even what we would consider non nutritive like zile a tall earth for tall stevia and al yellows appear to have less detrimental effects and fact even how yellows may even have slightly beneficial effects on glycemic control due to sgl t one signaling but a little too soon to say that so this now comes back to a heuristic which is like how do i behave around these things and i a moment ago said well i'm clearly consuming some of them so it's hard to get a protein drink out there even the cleanest ones out there that doesn't have some amount of these products in them in the protein powders and drinks that i use generally have sucralose in them that seems to be the one does your so many get a little bit there i already kind of looted to the fact i don't really drink diet soda as because i'm mostly just drink and sparkling water i don't add it to anything i consume so from drinking coffee it's i put a little cream in it but i'm not sweetening it so more or less it doesn't really appear in what i do although i do chew gum with xylitol in it all the gum i chew has a lot on it and that's more around some of the potential benefits of xylitol on the enamel of teeth so my advice to people who are consuming lots of artificial sweeteners who are struggling with less you make control body weight or things like that is substitute them out but don't substitute sugar in just get rid of it period so go from drinking diet coke to drinking water probably water not drinking coke because i think that's probably a worse outcome if no other reason just from more calories coming in but i think that if you're struggling on that front getting rid of those things might matter the area where i still think we are most interested in understanding things is what is the impact of these things on the gun the gut and how foreigner these things to the bacteria in our gut and are they being provided and a high enough quantity to even material impact the gutsy other some data some animal studies that suggest that this is a big issue i think it's a bit too soon to say that so yeah that sort of how i would talk about sugar substitutes for people who want to dive deeper into that will link to on our content on that machine outs and yeah i think that sugar substitutes piece was i can't think of a piece off hand that you in the team worked on that was lager remember redknapp for the first time and use kept scrolling and grown and grown so it's an insanely good resource for bueller gonna look at but then also to go back to and it's broken out by all the different substitutes and it's a really awesome piece the last thing to look out in nutrition is something else that i feel has been talked about for such a long time and are always comes back around you've written about this back in the early stages of the blog even before there was a podcast my feel every now and then there's a new documentary that comes out or a new piece of content in it raises the question again which is does red meat give you cancer and so if you had to look at that statement that say just red meat gives you cancer where would you rank that in our ranking system today so is going to sound bold but i would actually put this in the nonsense category which is not to say that a dietary pattern high in red meat could not play a role in the development of cancer but that's very different than the question so if the question is does red meat cause cancer i think that is not correct and i think there's plenty of evidence that that is not correct if the question is do people who eat a lot a red meat or do people who eat a lot of processed red meat have a higher risk of getting cancer i think the as i question is yes but it's probably less because of the meat although in the case of certain processing it may be the case but it's probably much more because of what they're not eating it's probably much more because their diets tend to be much lower in vegetables and specifically much lower in insoluble fiber which plays very important role in the prevention of colorectal cancer so the debate on redmayne cancer goes back for long periods of time and again it suffers from all of the usual trappings of nutritional epidemiology which is why john i need is famously said that all nutritional epidemiology belongs in the wastebasket the two most obvious problems with nutritional epidemiology in this regard are that it's very difficult to get an accurate reflection of what people consume using food frequency questionnaire years it's almost impossible and secondly and i think more seriously it's very difficult to disentangle the variable of interest from the other lifestyle variables that are cove very it's within the problem and that speak to what we refer to as the healthy user bias so i don't dispute for one moment that every time you do and epidemiologic survey and you compare people who live on hotdogs and pepperoni to vegetarians the epidemiology will always tell you that the vegetarians are going to live longer and while that might be an extreme example you do appreciate that on average those vegetarians have a much higher socio economic status they are much more health conscious they are exercising much more they are much less likely to be smoking doing yoga all these other things and therefore how can we disentangle the variable from the effect when you look at the most compelling case for people who eat the highest amount of meat and their risk of cancer there was a study that was done in europe that looked at nearly half a million people and it divided them into a cohort they were eating more than a hundred and sixty grams per day of protein from red meat and processed meat and it compared them to people that were eating virtually none twenty grams per day so again i like when they do this because you're at least taking like the most extremes and indeed there was a difference but it was relatively small so even under that setting that was the difference between a one point seven increasing the risk of cancer versus a one point three percent absolute risk for colorectal cancer over the period of study so just again what does that mean it means that the difference in risk between these super high protein consuming meet group and the low group was euro point four percent of actual percentage points so that means basically you have to put two hundred and fifty people on a low meat diet to reduce one case of colorectal cancer and again that's assuming that you arrived at this through randomization which you didn't so the in there was another study that was done was a tenure observational study that looked at about one hundred and fifty thousand people with the highest her tile of red meat consumption and they had a fifty percent increase in relative risk to those in the lowest her towel the error bar on this study was so big that it barely made statistical significance despite the sample size their which i think again just speaks to the heterogeneity of this that i would say that every one of these studies basically ends up having the same issue with it which is when you look at the details you realize it is very difficult to come up with a meaningful view that it's red meat specifically that is driving cancer as opposed to the absence of vegetables the absence of fiber or maybe the presence of some of the ultra processing things that go into consuming certain patterns of meat like gas station bought jerky and stuff like that so we could talk a lot more about this i really think that the health effects the ill health effects for red meat consumption is incredibly weak the hazard ratios themselves for this are very very small even with all of the limitations that i've mentioned and so therefore if you go back to kind of the austen bradford hill criteria of epidemiology which i outlined in great detail in the book very hard to imagine that there is causality here in fact the epidemiology here is so underwhelming that it almost draws the opposite conclusion it's almost hard to believe there is a signal given how underwhelming the epidemiologist whereas conversely when you look at the epidemiology of smoking where the epidemiology of exercise those are so overwhelming that it factors into what we see as the overall causality narrative or attribute i think really interesting and i think they're kind of wraps nutrition section and so you mentioned earlier on there is a really large list of topics that people want us to hit so it's safe to say that this won't be the last one we do even though it's the first one on this topic and so and people do like this theme of kind of going through and ranking these things let us know because we have a huge list of items that we can hit kind of moving forward but with all that said anything else jump out to you before we and what is the three hundred episode of the podcast know i would reiterate that though if people like this style of hey yeah normally we just do super deep dives but maybe once in awhile we do a summary synthesis of evolving positions on things glass now and we'll obviously look to do that more it's certainly been kind of fun to do this yeah what what i say it's hard for me to imagine where we're going to be in one hundred episodes then what's exciting to me as to imagine how many more things i will know and one hundred episodes and how many things that will change my mind on the evolution of the podcast for me has been so exciting because it's fresh an amazing way to be forced to learn so much all the time yeah definitely it's really interesting seen some of the guess we have lined up and the topics and themes that will be covering are you mention their mouth of the and we talked about exercise an aging population so i think we have some really good and interesting episodes coming up on topics and i think people the excited about self until then have ago you to thank you for listening to
